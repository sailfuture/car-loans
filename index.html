Your clean record, free of accidents and violations, ensures you pay the base rate for your car insurance." },
        { record: "Minor Violations (Speeding, Stop Sign Violations)", narrative: "After receiving a speeding ticket, your monthly insurance premium increases by 15%, reflecting the added risk from your minor traffic violation. This uptick serves as a financial reminder for you to adhere more closely to traffic laws." },
        { record: "Major Violations (Reckless Driving)", narrative: "Following a charge for reckless driving, you see a 30% hike in your insurance costs, a significant penalty for your major driving violation. This increase not only impacts your wallet but also marks you as a high-risk driver to insurers." },
        { record: "At-Fault Accidents", narrative: "Being involved in an at-fault accident leads to a 35% increase in your insurance premium. This rise reflects the heightened risk and potential for future claims that insurers associate with drivers who have caused accidents." },
        { record: "Multiple Incidents", narrative: "With a history of multiple driving incidents, including both violations and accidents, your insurance premium has surged by 50%. This substantial increase is a consequence of your repeated lapses in safe driving, making you a notably high-risk client for insurance companies." }

This is due to the perceived risk associated with lending to individuals with lower credit scores, significantly increasing the cost of your loan." },
        { score: "550", interestRate: "12%", narrative: "Your credit score of 550 places you in a moderately risky category for lenders, resulting in a 12% interest rate on your auto loan. This rate reflects a cautious approach from lenders due to your mid-range credit score, indicating a fair but still uncertain creditworthiness." },
        { score: "630", interestRate: "8%", narrative: "A credit score of 630 puts you in a somewhat favorable position with lenders, attracting an 8% interest rate on your loan. This improved rate suggests lenders recognize a lower risk in extending credit to you, compared to lower score ranges." },
        { score: "720", interestRate: "5%", narrative: "With a credit score of 720, you are considered a low-risk borrower, securing a favorable 5% interest rate on your auto loan. This score signals strong creditworthiness, leading lenders to offer you more attractive loan terms." },
        { score: "810", interestRate: "2%", narrative: "Holding an excellent credit score of 810 places you in the top tier, warranting the lowest interest rate of 2% for your auto loan. This score demonstrates exceptional credit health, convincing lenders to offer you the most advantageous borrowing terms." }

        { duration: "4 Years", narrative: "Longer term that reduces monthly payments, suitable for moderately priced vehicles." },
        { duration: "5 Years", narrative: "One of the most popular loan terms, offering manageable payments over a medium term." },
